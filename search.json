This report presents estimates of poverty using the official definition of poverty and estimates of deprivation using the MDI based on information collected primarily in the American Community Survey.”\n\n\nTime Frame\nMixed; 2010 to 2019; 2017\n\n\nSpatial Scale\nState and County\n\n\nFormat\nShapefile\n\n\nSource\nUS Census Bureau\n\n\nOriginal Repository\n2010 to 2019 2017\n\n\nLiving Atlas\nN/A\n\n\n\nDetails\nMDI value is equal to the percent of households in that region that qualify as “deprived.” Can be treated as an exposure value.
