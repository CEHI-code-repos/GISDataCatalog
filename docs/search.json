Their primary purpose is the same as census tracts: the presentation of statistical data. However, rather than nesting within a county, tribal census tracts nest within a single federally recognized American Indian area, providing coverage across all federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands. Tribal census tracts have population criteria identical to county-based census tracts.\nIf you would like attributes associated with these Tribal Census Tract Boundaries, you can visit https://data2.nhgis.org/main.
