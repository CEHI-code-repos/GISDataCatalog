**Details**\
MDI value is equal to the percent of households in that region that qualify as “deprived.” Can be treated as an exposure value. A composite measure based on six dimensions:

-   Neighborhood Quality
-   Standard of Living
-   Education
-   Health
-   Economic Security
-   Housing Quality

Cannot map by individual dimension.
