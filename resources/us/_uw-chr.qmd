**Details**\
This dataset offers county level estimates of health outcomes and risk factors. Estimates help identify ares requiring improvement and guide the creation and use of effective, focused health interventions. As a result of the difficulty in finding local intervention effects, users should be careful when using these figures to judge programs or policies.
