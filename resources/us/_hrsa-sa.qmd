**Details**\
HRSAâ€™s Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) develops shortage designation criteria and uses them to decide whether or not a geographic area or population group is a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA), Medically Underserved Area (MUA), or Medically Underserved Population (MUP). For HPSAs, scores range from 1 to 25 for primary care and mental health, 1 to 26 for dental health. The higher the score, the greater the priority. HPSAs may have shortages of primary medical care, dental, or mental health providers; may be urban or rural areas; population groups; or medical or other public facilities.
