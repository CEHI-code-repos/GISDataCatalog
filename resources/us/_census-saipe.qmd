**Details**\
This research presents yearly estimates of income and poverty data, encompassing: 

-   Total number of people in poverty

-   Number of children under age 18 in poverty

Produced for every school district, county, and state, these figures help pinpoint locations with high poverty rates, which in turn informs policy choices and the creation of targeted solutions.
