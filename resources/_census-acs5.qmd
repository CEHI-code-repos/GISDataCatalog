**Details**\
The Living Atlas hosts the current ACS 5-year estimates in a series of several features grouped by topic. Each topic is hosted as both [boundaries and centroids](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/41743d0d5364488fb51d795d65b40b37). Topics may contain single or multiple ACS tables Layers can be [accessed and used](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=c6a35a434a8f4913b9c35022290efdd0) within your GIS workflows, for example, [make a map about your community](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-living-atlas/mapping/make-an-acs-map-fast/).

If you are looking for historical data, the census.gov website can be difficult to go through. [Census Reporter](https://censusreporter.org/) can make it easier to find and download tables at various spatial scales.
