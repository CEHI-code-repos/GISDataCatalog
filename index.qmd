**Details**\
This project reported city- and census tract-level data and used small area estimation methods to obtain 27 chronic disease measures for the 500 largest American cities. Dataset includes estimates for 27 measures ([definitions here](https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html)):

-   Chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors (5),
-   Health outcomes (13), and
-   Use of preventive services (9).

These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations.

**Details**\
The Living Atlas hosts the current ACS 5-year estimates in a series of several features grouped by topic. Each topic is hosted as both [boundaries and centroids](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/41743d0d5364488fb51d795d65b40b37). Topics may contain single or multiple ACS tables Layers can be [accessed and used](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=c6a35a434a8f4913b9c35022290efdd0) within your GIS workflows, for example, [make a map about your community](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-living-atlas/mapping/make-an-acs-map-fast/).

If you are looking for historical data, the census.gov website can be difficult to go through. [Census Reporter](https://censusreporter.org/) can make it easier to find and download tables at various spatial scales.

: {tbl-colwidths="\[20,80\]"}

**Details**\
This project reported city- and census tract-level data and used small area estimation methods to obtain 29 chronic disease measures for the United States.

Dataset includes estimates for 29 measures (definitions here):

-   Chronic Disease Related Health Outcomes (13)
-   Prevention Measures (9)
-   Health Risk Behaviors (4)
-   Disability (7)
-   Health Status (3)

These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations.

**Details**\
The classification contains two levels. Whole numbers (1-10) delineate metropolitan, micropolitan, small town, and rural commuting areas based on the size and direction of the primary (largest) commuting flows. These 10 codes are further subdivided based on secondary commuting flows, providing flexibility in combining levels to meet varying definitional needs and preferences.

**Details**\
HRSA’s Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) develops shortage designation criteria and uses them to decide whether or not a geographic area or population group is a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA), Medically Underserved Area (MUA), or Medically Underserved Population (MUP). For HPSAs, scores range from 1 to 25 for primary care and mental health, 1 to 26 for dental health. The higher the score, the greater the priority. HPSAs may have shortages of primary medical care, dental, or mental health providers; may be urban or rural areas; population groups; or medical or other public facilities.

**Details:**\
Tribal census tracts are small statistical subdivisions of a reservation and off- reservation trust land. Their primary purpose is the same as census tracts: the presentation of statistical data. However, rather than nesting within a county, tribal census tracts nest within a single federally recognized American Indian area, providing coverage across all federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands. Tribal census tracts have population criteria identical to county-based census tracts.
