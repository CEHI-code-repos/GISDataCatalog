We've recently updated all our the datasets. A standout is the Climate & Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST), which has been taken down, but archived by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative.

We also have a new addition! Check out the [Hawaii tab](../../hawaii.qmd) for some Hawaii-specific data resources.

If you have any suggestions or notice any updates that need to be made, please feel free to contact Ryan Zomorrodi ([rzomor2\@uic.edu](mailto:rzomor2@uic.edu)).

Best, The CEHI Training Team
