For HPSAs, scores range from 1 to 25 for primary care and mental health, 1 to 26 for dental health. The higher the score, the greater the priority. HPSAs may have shortages of primary medical care, dental, or mental health providers; may be urban or rural areas; population groups; or medical or other public facilities.\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n## Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)\n\n|                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Description**         | The [Social Vulnerability Index](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html) uses 15 U.S. census variables to help local officials identify communities that may need support before, during, or after disasters. |\n| **Time Frame**          | Year; 2000, 2010, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| **Spatial Scale**       | County and Census Tract                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| **Format**              | CSV and Shapefile                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| **Source**              | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| **Original Repository** | [All Years](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/data_documentation_download.html)                                                                                                                                     |\n| **Living Atlas**        | [2018](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cbd68d9887574a10bc89ea4efe2b8087) [2020](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=05709059044243ae9b42f469f0e06642)                                                            |\n\n: {tbl-colwidths=\"\\[20,80\\]\"}\n\n**Details**\\\nRanking by social vulnerability.

Their primary purpose is the same as census tracts: the presentation of statistical data.

Dataset includes estimates for 27 measures ([definitions here](https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html)):\n\n-   Chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors (5),\n-   Health outcomes (13), and\n-   Use of preventive services (9).\n\nThese estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations.\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n## American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Estimates\n\n|                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Description**         | \"The [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html) (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides vital information on a yearly basis about our nation and its people.
