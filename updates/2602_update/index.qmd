Our list of National GIS Data has a new addition: the Grocery Gap Atlas! It may be interesting to any of you who would like to look at access to food and corporate concentration of grocery markets.

All prior datasets have been updated with new years of data, if applicable.

If you have any suggestions or notice any updates that need to be made, please feel free to contact Ryan Zomorrodi ([rzomor2\@uic.edu](mailto:rzomor2@uic.edu)).
