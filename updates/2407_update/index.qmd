We've recently added new datasets focused on health, socioeconomic factors, and environmental justice. The new additions include:

-   **Environmental Justice Index (EJI)**

-   **County Health Rankings & Roadmaps**

-   **Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) Program**

-   **Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) Program**

-   **Methodology & Data - Climate & Economic Justice Screening Tool**

If you have any suggestions or notice any updates that need to be made, please feel free to contact Ryan Zomorrodi ([rzomor2\@uic.edu](mailto:rzomor2@uic.edu)).
